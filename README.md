# Catnip-Cogs
A variety of "high quality" and "creative" cogs created by Danstr and Plasma for Red-Discordbot.
But, c'mon, we know you are just wondering if we borked everything.
I mean look at us, we're both ex-poops!

# Installation
Installing our top notch cogs is as simple as calculating wave movement!
Wait what? We still havent figured that out yet.... scratch that then!
There are two steps to installing our cogs:
  1. `[p]cog repo add Catnip-Cogs https://github.com/Catnipz/Catnip-Cogs`
  2. `[p]cog install Catnip-Cogs <COG NAME>`
  
# Available cogs
